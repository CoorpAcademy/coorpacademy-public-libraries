## How To Create a new lib

To create a new library, just copy the `project-template` from [the packages folder](./packages/project-template))
To have it test add it's folder namer to the [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) : `PACKAGE=my-project`

This is to be automated in the close future, and will be available under the `npm run scaffold-project` command.
